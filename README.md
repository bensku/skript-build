# Skript Nightly Builds
These builds are created each night if there have been commits to master
branch the day before. They are probably somewhat unstable, so use with
care. In worst case, they may cause serious damage, so... Be careful.

Please do not report issues in these releases to issue tracker of Skript.

## Looking for "Stable" Builds?
Check [releases](https://github.com/bensku/Skript) in main Skript repo.
They might be broken, too, but I at least try to support them.
